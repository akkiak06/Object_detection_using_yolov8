#Relevence_of_object_detection
Object tracking is an important task in computer vision. It involves identifying objects in a video and interpreting them as a set of trajectories with high accuracy¹. Here are some real-time uses of object tracking:

1. *Surveillance*: Object tracking is used in surveillance systems to monitor and track individuals or objects in real-time³.
2. *Robotics*: Robots use object tracking to interact with their environment effectively³.
3. *Self-driving cars*: Autonomous vehicles use object tracking to detect and avoid obstacles on the road³.
4. *Office occupancy management*: Object tracking can help understand how employees move throughout the building during the day, whether there are enough meeting rooms, and identify under- and overused spaces².
5. *Retail space management*: Retailers can use object tracking to optimize the way people shop in their stores by building tracks for every visitor and analyzing them².
6. *Video surveillance and security*: Object tracking can help identify if unauthorized people or vehicles visit restricted areas².

These are just a few examples. The applications of object tracking are vast and continue to grow with advancements in technology.

Extract the folder out of Downloaded Zip File.

Open the folder using VS code

Run app.py by clicking on triangular button on the top right.

Once you run app.py, you can see the option of terminal.

Install the necessary modules using the following commands in terminal:
pip install torch PyYAML seaborn torch torchvision torchaudio opencv-contrib-python 

Once you install the necessary modules, and run app.py, you will be getting a URL to access your web page like Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
